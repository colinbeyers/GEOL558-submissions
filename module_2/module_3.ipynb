    "This project aims to classify sea states based on oceanographic variables such as significant wave height, wave period, and wind speed. Sea states are crucial for maritime activities, providing valuable information on potential hazards and navigational conditions. Machine learning (ML) is employed to automate the classification process, leveraging large datasets and complex relationships between environmental factors that are difficult to model explicitly using traditional approaches. The project uses observational data from a NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy 46025, off the coast of Malibu. This buoy measures significant wave height (WVHT), wave period (DPD), and wind speed (WSPD), which are key predictors of sea state conditions. By applying ML, the project can efficiently analyze and classify sea state conditions in real-time, helping decision-makers in shipping, navigation, and coastal management."

This was to ensure that my testing set was as independent as possible from my training set and to avoid autocorrelation issues. As with most geophysical data, observations close in time to one another are not independent---they are related to some decorrelation scale. A random split very likely would have put data that is closely correlated in both the training and testing set. Also, using this method of temporal splitting also assessed how my model was able to generalize. As I had 1 year of data, the last 20% of data was from the winter months of 2023. Wave conditions are not the same all year round (and are highly seasonal), so using data from a different season assessed how well the model was able to generalize to new conditions."
